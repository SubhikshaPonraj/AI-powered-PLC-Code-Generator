## ✨ Features

🔑 **Natural Language Input** – Generate PLC logic directly from plain English instructions.  
⚡ **AI-powered Conversion** – Uses trained models to translate text into IEC 61131-3 compliant code.  
🛠️ **Multiple Formats** – Supports Structured Text (ST) and Ladder Diagram (LD) generation.  
🌍 **Cross-Platform** – Compatible with widely used PLC environments.  
📄 **Custom Rules** – Extendable rules for company-specific automation workflows.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User enters automation logic in **natural language** (e.g., *“Turn on motor when sensor detects object”*).  
2. The system’s **AI model** parses and interprets the instruction.  
3. Code is automatically generated in **PLC programming format**.  
4. The generated code can be reviewed, exported, and deployed to PLC hardware.
